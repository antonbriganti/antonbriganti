- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonbriganti, this is my personal github
- 💖 I'm passionate about starting projects and forgetting to finish them
- 🤔 Currently building platforms
- 🖋️ I write a blog about a bunch of stuff, read it [here](https://blog.antonbriganti.com)
- 📫 If you've somehow found this in isolation and want to talk about work, [hit me up on LinkedIn I guess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-briganti/)
